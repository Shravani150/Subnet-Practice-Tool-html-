# Subnet-Practice-Tool-html-

## Overview
This is a simple **interactive web application** designed to help users practice identifying IP address attributes. The app presents a random IP address, and users have to fill in its **Network IP, Broadcast ID, Next Network ID, First Host ID, Last Host ID, Number of IPs, and Subnet**. Once submitted, the app checks the answers and shows the correct values.

The project is perfect for **networking students or enthusiasts** who want to improve their understanding of IP addressing and subnetting.
